                        Yes, HTML, CSS, and PLC programming (specifically Logicmaster and Proficy Machine Edition) are not considered to be 
                        programming languages, but there you go...&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to maintaing the Access Controls system and all things electrical at GE Lighting's 97-acre NELA Park campus, 
                        I was introduced to embedded C++ and 3D printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experience with SolidWorks, but have become proficient with Autodesk's 123D Design product.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        My PLC programming skills were fine-tuned with projects like building an entrance gate controller that interfaces with a variable frequency drive and card reader, editing existing 
                        programs to control movable ceiling panels, and animating our <i>world-famous</world-famous></i> Christmas display!&nbsp;&nbsp;Programming the PLC's for the display eventually led 
                        me to the amazing world of microcontrollers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I immersed myself into embedded C++ development, learning everything I could about this new found world.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as 
                        the programming bug worked its way through my system, web development became my next passion.&nbsp;&nbsp;After an intense Coding Bootcamp at CWRU, I received a certificate in Full 
                        Stack Web Development

                    <p>
                        As an IBEW Journeyman, I learned the importance of the acronym <span class="text-secondary">ASK</span>:
                        <p><span class="text-secondary">Attitude</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;is everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;I was ingrained with the attitude to get the job done by overcoming obstacles and adapting to changes, 
                            continuing towards success.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="text-secondary">Skill</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Many of my peers consider me to be an excellent electrician.&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe my skillset to all of the IBEW journeymen who 
                            were patient and generous with their time and talents.
                        </p>
                        <p><span class="text-secondary">Knowledge</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The 5-year apprenticeship provided me with the knowledge to ply my trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better way to learn a 
                            skill or trade than through an apprenticeship.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an apprentice, I studied 8 hours every 2 weeks and applied that knowledge while working with other journeymen.

                        Most of my experience is in the commercial sector, working at various businesses in northeast Ohio (including GE NELA Park) doing large-scale construction projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the industrial sector, I have worked at the Arcelor/Mittal 
                        steel mill and Ashland Chemical doing PLC and Class I, Divisions I and II work.
