                <h2>GE Lighting, a Savant company</h2>
                <h4>Embedded SW QA Test Engineer / Electrician / Programmer.languages.push("C++", "JavaScript", "HTML",
                    "CSS", "PLC", "Python", "Go");</h4>
                <p>
                    Yes, HTML, CSS, and PLC programming (specifically Logicmaster and Proficy Machine Edition) are not
                    considered to beprogra mming languages, but there you go...
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition to maintaing the Access Controls
                    system and all things electrical at GE Lighting's 97-acre NELA Park campus,
                    I was introduced to embedded C++ and 3D printing.&nbsp;&nbsp;I have experience with SolidWorks, but
                    have become proficient with Autodesk's 123D Design and Fusion 360 products.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                    My PLC programming skills were fine-tuned with projects like building an entrance gate controller
                    and animating our <i>world-famous</world-famous></i>
                    Christmas display!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Programming the PLC's for the display eventually led
                    me to the amazing world of microcontrollers.&nbsp;&nbsp;I immersed myself into embedded C++
                    development, learning everything I could about this new found world.&nbsp;&nbsp;And as
                    the programming bug worked its way through my system, web development became my next
                    passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After an intense Coding Bootcamp at CWRU, I received a certificate in Full
                    Stack Web Development.&nbsp;&nbsp;Soon afterward, an opportunity became available on the Connected
                    Home Team, putting my electrical, electronics and programming skills to the test.&nbsp;&nbsp;My
                    favorite project was building a touchscreen-controlled GUI on a Raspberry Pi for compatibility
                    testing of WiFi routers.&nbsp;&nbspI am cureently working on Python software to automate testing
                    the latest Cync products with voice agents like Alexa and Google Home!

                <h4>Journeyman Electrician / Foreman</h4>
                <p>
                    As an IBEW Journeyman, I learned the importance of the acronym <span
                        class="text-secondary">ASK</span>:
                <p><span class="text-secondary">Attitude</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;is everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;The attitude to
                    get the job done by overcoming obstacles and adapting to changes quickly became ingrained into my
                    daily work habits, allowing for continued success in every project.
                </p>
                <p><span class="text-secondary">Skill</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Many of my peers consider me to be an excellent
                    electrician.&nbsp;&nbsp;I owe my skillset to all of the IBEW journeymen who
                    were patient and generous with their time and talents.
                </p>
                <p><span class="text-secondary">Knowledge</span>&nbsp;-&nbsp;The 5-year apprenticeship provided me with
                    the knowledge to ply my trade.&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no better way to learn a
                    skill or trade than through an apprenticeship.&nbsp;&nbsp;As an apprentice, I studied 8 hours every
                    2 weeks and applied that knowledge while working with other journeymen.
                </p>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of my experience is in the commercial sector, working at various businesses in northeast Ohio
                    (including GE NELA Park) doing large-scale construction projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;In the industrial
                    sector, I have worked at the Arcelor/Mittal
                    steel mill and Ashland Chemical doing PLC and Class I, Divisions I and II work.
